## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://www.w3schools.com/

https://stackoverflow.com/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Some challenges I encountered while writing this program include learning new Javascript syntax and features as I went along, as well as trying to implement 
features of the Web Audio API. I have previously only worked with Javascript in the context of using Discord.js, so I was only familiar with some of the general rules. 
To overcome this, I mainly used my prior knowledge from other languages and applied that to this, occasionally looking up some specific syntax rules on w3schools.com 
or stackoverflow.com. I specifically had to research how to generate random numbers to fill the pattern array. I also chose to do a bit of research on the Web Audio API 
and found some interesting tutorials on using filters and other types of oscillators. I was not able to implement most of these features due to time constraints, but I 
did try out a few different waveforms. I also had to research the correct frequencies for the 9 additional notes of the scale that I used. As for HTML and CSS, those two 
languages are very different from any of the conventional languages I am proficient in. Iâ€™ve had some prior experience with them, mostly using pre-built code blocks from 
Bootstrap, so building this from scratch was a little more challenging. I had to look up how to change the background of a button to an image, and actually found that it 
was a relatively simple solution. Overall, this project was a good introduction to web development using Javascript for me, and I am excited to learn more in the future.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I am curious as to how various Javascript frameworks make the development of interactive sites easier and more efficient. This is a relatively small project that still 
took a few hours to develop, so I imagine much more sophisticated sites take a lot longer to build. However, I have heard a lot about frameworks such as React and Angular, 
and I wonder what their capabilities are. I am also curious about how other languages can be used for more back end development. I have heard of languages like Python, C#, 
and even C++ being used for backend web development, but I have never encountered anything related to the web when working with Python or C++ myself. Lastly, I would like 
to learn more about database integration into web apps, as I know storing user data is important for most apps that want to create a personalized experience.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The next thing I wanted to add was keyboard functionality, so that the user could trigger certain buttons by pressing certain keys on their keyboard. I also wanted
to play around with the audio synthesizer a little more, since I am a musician myself and I am somewhat familiar with audio synthesis. I wanted to try to synthsize a sound
that was more similar to the noise a piano makes. I have never programmed with it before, though, so I found it to be challenging, but still interesting.
